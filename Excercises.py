# 31 Let’s continue building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).
#
# Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”.
# For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.
# For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word.
# As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and display a different message if the player tries to guess that letter again.
# Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly!
# Don’t worry about choosing a word randomly or keeping track of the number of guesses the player has remaining - we will deal with those in a future exercise.

# Exercise 1
# Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
